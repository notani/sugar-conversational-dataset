# SUGAR: A Textual Dataset for Situated Proactive Response Selection

This repository contains data for the paper ["Otani et al. 2023. A Textual Dataset for Situated Proactive Response Selection."](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.214/)

SUGAR (a dataset of SitUatated, Goal-Aware, and proactive Responses) contains 1,760 examples of single-turn English conversations in help-seeking scenarios. Each example includes a user request anchored by an implicit goal, a reference response, two extra response candidates, and 12 sentences of situational information. All response candidates are annotated with three-point appropriateness ratings to develop and evaluate response selection systems. The use of SUGAR is not limited to the development/evaluation of response selection systems. For instance, you can train situated response generation systems using SUGAR (See also [(Otani et al., NLP4ConvAI 2023)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.nlp4convai-1.2/)).
